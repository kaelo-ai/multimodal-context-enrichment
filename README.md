# Multimodal AI for Movie Metadata Context Enrichment
This is a multimodal AI project, that enriches movie metadata by combining movie trailers (video) and text descriptions (plot). By integrating these two data types, we create enriched metadata, specifically a comprehensive synopsis, which can enhance search and recommendation services on streaming platforms.
